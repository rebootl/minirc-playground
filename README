minirc playground
=================


Personal playground to experiment w/ minirc
and to provide a "working" configuration example,
but _not intented to be used on other systems_
use the appropriate sources or packages instead.

Based upon the installed files of minirc on Arch.


branches
- master (unmodified files)
- devel modified to my personal preference/convenience
- sinit modified to replace busybox init by sinit
